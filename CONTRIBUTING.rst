Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `deck-chores` for local development.

1. Fork_ the `deck-chores` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/deck-chores.git

3. Install your local copy and developemnt tools into a virtualenv. Assuming
   you have pew_ installed, this is how you set up your fork for local
   development::

    $ cd deck-chores
    $ pew new -p $(which python) -a $(pwd) deck-chores
    $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    $ python setup.py develop

4. Create a branch for the scope of your issue or feature::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5a. When you're done making changes, reformat the code with black_ and check
    that your changes pass flake8 and the tests::

    $ make black
    $ make test

5b. If you want to run a container for testing purposes::

    $ make run-dev

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. The code must be formatted with black_ (see 6. above).
3. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
